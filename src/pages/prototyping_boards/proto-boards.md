# Luos prototyping boards

Luos provides simple electronic boards examples to build in order to start prototyping using Luos modular technology.
These examples are available on Github and contain the schematic and the Kicad file so that they can be easily reproduced to test Luos.

Start reading the [board's general use page](/pages/prototyping_boards/electronic-use.md), then you can read the [quick start page](/pages/prototyping_boards/quick-start.md) to start using your prototyping boards. You can consult the [list of available Luos boards examples](/pages/prototyping_boards/boards-list.md).
