# Hardware consideration

When creating a Luos network, if you have a product with several nodes, it is mandatory to configure your MCU, to create the physical layer. On our examples Luos use RS485 with a driver or one wire communication for this physical layer ([see Electronic design](./electronics.md)), but other communication way is possible.

Board examples and driver sources are available <a href="https://github.com/Luos-io/Examples/tree/master/Projects" target="_blank">on GitHub &#8599;</a>. We encourage you to use them in the way you want.

You can find the schematic of a Luos-ready board called L0 <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Microcontroller" target="_blank">on Github &#8599;<a> for a quick hardware example.
