# Hardware consideration

To create the Luos network, mandatory if you have a product with several node, you must configure your MCU to create and physical layer. Luos use RS485 with a driver or one wire communication for this physical layer (see Electronic design)

Board examples and electronic sources are available <a href="https://github.com/Luos-io/Examples/tree/master/Projects" target="_blank">on GitHub</a>. You are free to use them as you want.

You can find the schematic of a Luos-ready board called L0 <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Microcontroller" target="_blank">on Github<a> for a quick hardware example.
