# Low level
In an embedded development project, low level is the part which is the closest to the hardware, the programming of microcontrollers or the electronics of a system. This part of the Luos documentation is dedicated to people designing their own electronic boards or their specific embedded code.

Let's start by setting up your [**development environment**](./dev-env.md), then you can start your [**electronic design**](./physical_bus/electronic-design.md) and your [**containers**](./containers.md) creation.
