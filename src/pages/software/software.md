# Software control
This part of the Luos documentation is dedicated to people aiming to control or monitor a device trough a computer a server or a Raspberry Pi using classic programming ways such as Python, JavaScript, or Rust.

Luos provides a Python library, [**Pyluos**](./pyluos.md) and also works with [**ROS**](./ros.md). If you want to use another language, you should start reading about our [**JSON API**](./json-api.md).


## Device interface

Before using your device, you have to be connected to a [Gate container](../embedded/tools/gate.md) trough the pipe of your choice.
