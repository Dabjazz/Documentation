# Luos demonstration boards

Luos provides simple electronic boards examples to build in order to demonstrate the Luos modular technology.
These examples are available on Github and contain a schematic file and a Kicad file, so that they can be easily reproduced to test Luos.

Start reading the [board's general use page](./electronic-use.md), then you can read the [quick start page](./quick-start.md) to start using your demonstration boards. You can consult the [list of available Luos boards examples](./boards-list.md).
