## The most for the developer

As explained on the [basics page](./basics.md), Luos provides the developer with an architecture of the project and a way of creating communication features with standard types of messages understandable by any application. This way, you can encapsulate your development and share it either with your team or with an external developer, ensuring that your application will match every other app developed with Luos. Creating a wide range of products is now easy with Luos technology.
Luos is an open-source light library that can be ported on any MCU, leading to free and fast product development. Choosing Luos to design a product will help you debug and monitor its behavior, control it at a high level, and consider CICD for production.


## The most for the community

Most of the embedded development is being built from scratch. By using Luos, you will be able to capitalize on the development you, your company, or the Luos community already did. The reusability of features encapsulated with Luos will fasten the time your products reach the market and reassure the robustness and the universality of your application. You will find many new ideas and support of the community with Luos support packages existing on our marketplace.
