# Concept

## The most for the developer

As explained in [basics page](./basics.md), Luos provide the developer with an architecture of project, and a way of creating communication features with standard types of messages understandable by any application. This way you can encapsulate your development and share it either with your team or with an external developer, making sure that your application will match with every other app developed with Luos. Creating a wide range of products is now easy with Luos technology.
Luos is an open source light library that can be ported on any MCU, leading to a free and fast product development. Choosing Luos to design a product will help you to debug and monitor its behavior, control it at a high level, and take CICD into consideration for the production.


## The most for the community

Most of the embedded development is being build from scratch. By using Luos, you will be able to capitalize on development already done by you, your company or Luos community. The reusability of features encapsulated with Luos, will fasten the time that your products reach the market and reassure the robustness and the universality of your application. You will find a lot of new ideas and support of the community with Luos support packages existing on our market place.
