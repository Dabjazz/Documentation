# Luos Hardware Abstraction Layer

Luos can work on a single node (localhost), or create a network for communication between services located on different nodes. This communication should be defined and hardware-configured to fit with the chosen MCU. The files *luos_hal.c* and *luos_hal.h* define all the functions needed by the Luos library to send/receive messages through the bus and initialize of all MCU peripherals.

The file luos_hal_config.h file contains a default configuration for an MCU family and can be redefined in a `node_config.h` configuration file to fit your design. The configuration of Luos HAL is described [here](../../hardware-consideration/mcu.md).

## Luos HAL
Here is all the hardware functions relative to protocol communication and physical bus of Luos:

- **PORT**: Defines necessary pins, PTP lines, Rx/Tx, enable/disable.
- **TIMER**: Defines timeouts for communication.
- **COM**: Serial bus.
- **CRC**: Validates the accuracy of the messages. CRC can be generated by hardware (Optional, can be software).
- **DMA**: Used to save IRQ time (Optional, can be IT only).
- **FLASH**: Stores services' aliases in the system, and used by [Luos bootloader](../../tools/boot.md).
