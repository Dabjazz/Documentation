# High level
This part of the Luos documentation is dedicated to people aiming to control or monitor a device trough a computer or a Raspberry Pi using classic programming ways such as Python, JavaScript, or Rust.

Luos provides a Python library, [**Pyluos**](/pages/high/pyluos.md) and also works with [**ROS**](/pages/high/ros.md). If you want to use another language, you should start reading about our [**JSON API**](/pages/high/json-api.md).
