Some IoT, edge and embedded projects should not involve such a dependence on hardware.

The dependency would lead to a limitation of possibilities.

<!--truncate-->

The technique should not alter or limit the imagination and the development of ideas. Whether it comes from a lack of hardware knowledge or prioritization of other objectives, the project's development should be done without reinventing the wheel, spending hours redoing existing developments, and without stress.

Many examples are shared with us each month through our [Luos community](https://discord.gg/luos), but one example is currently part of the Luos teams. Alexis Gorlier is part of the French ESO association and is currently developing a rocket with a group of students from ESTACA.

The objective is to exceed the current European altitude record for an amateur flight, i.e., 32km.

Their astrophysics, propulsion, and mechanics skills are developing daily, but the field of embedded, computer, and software development is not their domain.

Let's continue with Alexis:

The courses given by ESTACA only give some basics on this part, so we need to conduct longer studies when we try to develop the electronic system for our IoT, edge or embedded projects. Therefore, keeping the electronic design simple is better to ensure we will have the expected results.

They have chosen to use Luos for several applications: to measure the altitude (necessary to validate their objective), to record events occurring during the flight, and last but not least, to trigger the parachute allowing the rocket to decelerate and arrive "almost" whole.

The aerospace field is a passion for us at Luos, and the cross-over was relevant, hence the presence of Alexis in the Luos team. You can discuss his edge project directly with him via our [Discord](https://discord.gg/luos).

<h2>Focus on your main objectives and not on technical constraints</h2>

The main objective is to get the rocket off the ground and exceed this altitude of 32km, the underlying objective of collecting the altitude and checking the flight plan was managed by Luos. The association teams increased their skills on Luos by performing the Get Started and testing a proof of concept of parachute release.

<h3>Following the microservices philosophy, build and break down your IoT, edge or embedded projects into smaller goals.</h3>

Apart from the objectives related to the rocket takeoff, such as the [propulsion management](/img/blog/pdf/Propulsion-management-Rocket-project-Luos.pdf) or the [friction in the air](/img/blog/pdf/Rocket-stability-project-Luos.pdf), one of the other three objectives of the association was to divide the ancillary objectives into three services. This splitting philosophy is a concept we developed many times at Luos to gain agility. You can read [our article on monolithic vision compared to microservices vision](https://www.luos.io/blog/a-way-to-unleash-embedded-systems).

Thus, the objectives related to the Luos project were thought in microservices:

- Rocket altitude measurement service
- Expected objective:
    - Determine the evolution of altitude during the flight
- Devices concerned by this service:
    - Barometer
    - Thermometer
    - Inertial Unit

![Phases of flight](/img/blog/Phases-of-flight-rocket-project-Luos.svg)

You will notice that we are using three electronic components for this objective, even if each one could be used individually. This choice permits adding security if something goes wrong. For example, suppose the thermometer stops working correctly (totally stops working or gives wrong values). 

In that case, we will still be able to determine the altitude thanks to the Barometer and the inertial unit. We will also use several components of each type to add more security. This process is called redundancy. 

This principle is very important in this case because the altitude measurement will be used to initiate the parachute's liberation. Therefore, if we can't measure altitude anymore, the parachute will not be freed, so the mission will end up in a crash that will destroy the rocket. We already experienced this case in my association, with a liberation system that did not work correctly, resulting in the rocket's loss and all the onboard data. 

We call this kind of flight a "ballistic flight."

This redundancy constraint is part of the decision to use Luos on the edge project. Indeed, Luos permits creating a piece of code for a component that can be used everywhere in the system and even in other systems. Therefore, it is as easy to duplicate a component from a hardware point of view (connect another component to a board) as to duplicate a component from a software point of view (change the connected pins definition in code).

- Flight status recording service
- Expected objective:
    - Store all flight data on board
    - Transmit flight data to a ground station in real-time
- Equipment concerned by this service:
    - SD card
    - Telemetry

You will notice that we also have a different way to retrieve the flight data, one on board (SD card) and one on a ground station (telemetry).

This redundancy permits access to flight data even if the SD card is destroyed at the end of the flight (if the Rocket crash or has a bad impact at ground contact, for example).

- "Automatic parachute ejection hatch release” service
- Expected objective:
    - Eject the first parachute at apogee
    - Eject a second parachute at 1000m of altitude
- Equipment concerned by this service:
    - Barometer
    - Thermometer
    - Inertial Unit
    - Solenoids

Actual design of liberation system

The Barometer, the thermometer, and the Inertial unit are used to calculate altitude. There will let us know when apogee and 1000m of altitude are reached. The solenoids are used in the release system that will release the parachutes.

<h2>Hardware vs. Software development</h2>
<h3>Is hardware easier to modify than software?</h3>

This question is generally difficult to answer as it depends on the hardware and software involved. However, devices is typically more expensive and difficult to modify than software. This is because the devices is physical and therefore requires more time and effort to change, while the software is intangible and can be easily modified.

Software development today is no longer limited to the devices that hosts the code. We are forced to have machines running the code as the possibilities become unlimited. With Luos, we want the same agility in development and the same way of thinking about embedded and edge systems. We want Luos to make it possible to develop IoT, edge and embedded projects as easily as software.

Luos makes it easy to develop and scale your edge and embedded distributed software. It's open source. Get Started now: https://www.luos.io/tutorials/get-started

As you know, this edge project involves launching a rocket at 32km altitude. This objective gives a lot of constraints such as temperature, vibrations, components needed, etc. Moreover, we must have the best performance in energy consumption, space, mass, data rate, etc. Therefore, we must choose our components wisely, so the more possibilities we have, the better it is.

Luos works with every component and theoretically every board (some boards are yet to be developed because the technology is new). Therefore, using Luos doesn't limit our choice and permits us to use a Nucleo and an Arduino board in the same system.

</div>

Moreover, Luos are easy to use (thanks to the Get Started and the Tutorials on Luos official website), and the developers are very active and helpful. This is very important for us (astrophysical developers) as we don't have much experience in electronics. 

I try to make a part of the electronic system of this edge project. I did use a barometer to calculate an altitude and activate a solenoid when apogee is detected on my own using Luos. The most difficult part for me was to create the SPI driver for my Barometer and to start communicating with it.

![Hardware representation](/img/blog/Hardware_representation_iot_edge_embedded_project_alexis_gorlier_luos.svg)

Once I did it, I encountered some difficulties in using Luos, but nothing that I did not resolve in a short delay. 

The main difficulty I had was creating a new type of data incompatible with Luos. This part can take some time at first because you need to find what files to change to allow this type of variable in Luos, but once you find the good file, it is very easy to modify it correctly as you have a lot of examples for other types of variable. 

This is why I recommend exchanging a lot with the developers, especially when you use Luos for the first time, as they will quickly respond and permit you not to lose too much time finding the information you could not guess by yourself.

Another Luos advantage is the possibility to use the tool Pyluos. This tool will let you see your entire system and communicate with it in Python. 

The first thing I used Pyluos for was to see if Luos correctly interpreted my system. This permitted me, for example, to see that even if my program seemed to work correctly, I had a problem in the communication between my Barometer and my application that detects apogee thanks to the Barometer's values. 

Even if the values I received were correct, they were sent with the wrong type. This could have ended in bad communication between the two services, but when I saw that Pyluos could not work because of this mistake, I tried to figure out what was wrong and finally found a problem that would have been undetected without this tool. Another aspect of Pyluos that I used in this project is the possibility to send values to a service. 

This was very useful for testing my system's reaction because it is hard to simulate the pressure variation that the rocket will be exposed to (approximately 850 Pa at 32km of altitude). Thanks to Pyluos, I could send data to my application and simulate the flight without using a system that could lower the pressure down to 850 Pa.

<h2>Is your edge, IoT or embedded project evolving?</h2>
Don't worry. We're introducing: Modular programming in hardware development.

As your project gains agility with Luos, it becomes modular as a combination of bricks.

![Monolithic vs Microservices](/img/blog/Monolithic_vs_microservices_luos.svg)

We recently saw how [a shortage can impact project development](https://www.luos.io/blog/semiconductor-crisis-how-to-minimize-the-impact) and how to minimize that impact. They split the dependency between their code/software and their hardware boards by developing their project in microservices. 

We see that Alexis' team chooses an Arduino and STNucleo board to handle different tasks. Suppose a board of this brand is unavailable during production (or, in some cases, industrialization). 

In that case, changing this board and using a compatible board from our list of integrations is no problem. Oh, by the way, if integration does not exist yet, you are welcome to develop the one you are interested in with our community.

Luos and the ESO project have a deeper vision of developing a modular, agile, scalable project. Let's see, imagine a webcam broadcasting live the evolution of the rocket or an emergency system that monitors the rocket's status/rotation/position and makes a decision in real-time.

The possibilities will become endless and beyond.

Feel free to discuss with Alexis about this edge project on our Discord dedicated to embedded and edge developers.
