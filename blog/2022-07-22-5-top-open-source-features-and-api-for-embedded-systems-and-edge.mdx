![5 Top Open-source features and API for embedded systems and edge](/img/blog/5_Top_Open_Source_features_and_API_for_embedded_systems_and_Edge_Luos.png)

Open source has opened the gate to a new way of thinking in the embedded domain. Breaking away from the [monolithic](/2021-01-13-unleash-embedded.mdx) vision to focus on microservices is a choice that has many advantages.
<!--truncate-->
Many open-source projects have emerged due to the lack of existing solutions on the market, often at the initiative of developers who suffered from the lack of functionality in peripherals and embedded systems.

Edge devices are present in our environment and are focused on optimizing dependency, sustainability, and the relation between cloud resources. As this domain is constantly evolving, choosing open-source features allows everyone to adapt the code to their needs and benefit from the latest updates from the community. The Linux project is an excellent example.

Some domains can use open-source features to develop their embedded project: industry focused on data management, IoT, cloud industries, etc…

Let's talk about 5 top open-source features and APIs for embedded systems and edge.

<h2> 1. Bootloader for Embedded systems </h2>

As we mentioned earlier, we can use microservice thinking to optimize our embedded systems, and when some people talked about containers (like Docker), we spoke of nodes. A node comprises different hardware components, such as an MCU connected to the system. Each node can host several services, such as a DC motor, an LED, or a controller.

**The Bootloader** feature allows developers to quickly update the firmware of any node in an embedded system or device. Knowing every part of your system, programming tools, or drivers is unnecessary. A bootloader can quickly update your application software between your different boards.

Why is using a bootloader an advantage in the embedded field?

The bootloader makes it possible to quickly update an application software between the different nodes of a system.

It allows the installation of new services and applications on the system, which can be done in several ways: via USB, Ethernet, Wi-Fi, or Serial Port.

Bootloader can be used on different embedded systems and boards.

If you want to know more about the bootloader, please visit our [documentation](/docs/tools/boot).

<h2> 2. API gate between Embedded/Edge boards and cloud: Why use an API gate for embedded systems? </h2>

API gate allows developers to create an interface to manage different boards in an embedded system. It makes it possible to control the various boards in a system and develop new services and applications.

Each board usually has a specific function, such as monitoring a temperature sensor or controlling a DC motor.

With the API gate, developers can easily connect different boards to create an interface. This allows them to manage the various boards in a system and develop new services and applications. API gate can be used on different embedded systems and boards.

As we explain in [our documentation](/docs/tools/gate), the default behavior of the gate is optimized for a system that has only drivers and controls all behavior through a remote computer.

1. On power-up, the gate detects the network discovery to find a pipe service. (Optional)
2. The gate waits to receive a discovery message from a pipe.
3. The gate performs a new discovery in response to the discovery command and creates a formatted routing table to send back to the pipe.
4. The gate then determines the time required to convert the entire network values to the selected format. (Optional)
5. The gate sets up all network services to send their values back at the optimal frequency. (Optional)
6. The gate generates formatted data with this optimal frequency and sends commands coming from a pipe.

A new embedded community allows you to be informed about the embedded ecosystem and to share your knowledge with other developers: <a rel="noopener noreferrer external nofollow" href="https://discord.gg/luos" target="_blank">https://discord.gg/luos</a>

<h2> 3. Timestamp for Embedded systems </h2>

The timestamp is an essential feature in the embedded field. It allows developers to track an event's time and synchronize the different boards of a system.

Track an event is essential when we use different nodes on one system. Timestamp allows us to know if an event is triggered at the right time. If something happens in your system that causes a bug or significant defect, you will be able to monitor the status before and after a specific event. Seeing and testing this event in different configurations will allow you to quickly fix a bug without impacting your entire system.

This event tracking maybe even more relevant when we develop cloud-based devices. As the components used are dependent on many external factors, such as the mere presence of an internet connection, it is essential or even necessary for the engineers in charge of development to ensure the hit in a test environment before going into production. Once in production, this allows for continuous integration.

Having these event logs can help support teams understand, identify, and correct the problem more quickly in a support or user assistance context.

<h2> 4. Monitoring your Embedded system </h2>

Monitoring is a critical feature in the embedded field. It allows developers to monitor the different boards in a system and ensure that the system is working correctly. Monitoring can be done in several ways, such as via a USB port, Ethernet, Wi-Fi, or Serial Port.

With the monitoring feature, developers can easily connect different boards to create an interface. Monitoring can improve security in your system by identifying potential threats and by providing information to help you fix them. When you have faced an event, you can use this feature to trigger a new action.

In the cloud, you can use this feature to monitor your system from anywhere. Cloud device development engineers can easily trigger and identify the network impact on the cloud product before launch.

<h2> 5. HAL Open source for embedded systems </h2>

HAL is a feature that allows developers to easily create an interface between different hardware and software components. HAL makes it possible to easily connect other hardware and software components to create an interface. This allows developers to easily create new services and applications.

HAL can be used on different embedded systems and boards. Making HAL open-source allows developers to quickly adapt the code to their needs and benefit from the community's latest updates.

All these open source features are freely available on our Github repository: <a rel="noopener noreferrer external nofollow" href="https://github.com/Luos-io/luos_engine" target="_blank">https://github.com/Luos-io/luos_engine</a>

<h2> Bonus: JSON API interacts with your embedded system </h2>

Making JSON API open-source allows developers to quickly adapt the code to their needs and benefit from the community's latest updates. Many programming languages widely use JSON formatted data. Gate services allow you to convert any information into JSON objects so that traditional programming languages can easily interact with your device.

The use of the JSON language makes it easy to develop new services and applications.

**Added** **bonus:** find and interact with thousands of embedded and edge developers on open source features or tools on our Discord community: <a rel="noopener noreferrer external nofollow" href="https://discord.gg/luos" target="_blank">https://discord.gg/luos</a>

<h2> Conclusion </h2>

Open source has opened the way to a new way of thinking in the embedded domain. Breaking away from the monolithic vision to focus on microservices is a choice that has many advantages.

Many open-source projects have emerged due to the lack of existing solutions on the market, often at the initiative of developers who suffered from the lack of functionality in peripherals and embedded systems.

Edge devices are present in our environment and are focused on optimizing dependency, sustainability, and the relation between cloud resources.
