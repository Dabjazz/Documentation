# Embedded packages to simplify portability

ðŸ†• New feature in the Luos release 2.0.0: Packages to simplify portability

<!--truncate-->

Packages allow you to store your embedded code features on sharable folders. So you can move those easily from one project to another and share them with the community.

We have big plans for this feature so keep in touch... [more information about packages](https://docs.luos.io/docs/luos-technology/package)
