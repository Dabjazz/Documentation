# Luos Hardware Abstraction Layer

Luos can work on a single node using localhost communication or it can create a network for communication between services located on different nodes. This communication should be defined and hardware-configured to fit with the chosen MCU. The files luos_hal.c and luos_hal.h define all the functions needed by the Luos engine. Then there is HAL depending on the Network layer you use to send messages through the physical bus.

The file luos_hal_config.h file contains a default configuration for an MCU family and can be redefined in a configuration file to fit your design. The configuration of Luos engine HAL is described [here](/docs/hardware-consideration/mcu).

## Luos engine HAL

The Luos engine need some peripheral access to properly work :

- **TIMER**: Used for the systick and for the nanosecond precision timestamping of events
- **FLASH**: Stores services' aliases in the system and write your firmware on bootloader mode

## Robus HAL

Robus is the default Network layer used by Luos engine, Here is a lists of all the hardware peripherals used to drive the physical bus:

- **PORT**: Defines necessary pins, PTP lines, Rx/Tx, enable/disable
- **TIMER**: Defines timeouts for communications
- **COM**: Serial bus
- **CRC**: Optionaly used to optimze the messages validation. CRC can be generated by hardware or software
- **DMA**: Optionaly used to optimze the communication
