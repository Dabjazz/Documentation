# Timestamp

**Timestamp** is a feature that enables you to track the date at which an event occurs.

Let's take an example with a button driver: each time we read the button state, we want to timestamp this event.
To do that we have to save a time information representing our timestamp.

```C
#include "timestamp.h"

time_luos_t button_timestamp;
```

Then we can save our timestamp date when we read the state of the button:

```C
ll_button_read(&button.state);
button_timestamp = Timestamp_now();
```

After retrieving timestamp value you can do some calculation on it to include constant delay before measurement, or by adding a specific amount of time to manage future timestamp date.

Then you can send a message with your button value using `Luos_SendTimestampMsg`:
```C
Luos_SendTimestampMsg(button_service, button_msg, button_timestamp);
```

All **timestamp** API functions can be found in Luos_engine/engine/core/inc/timestamp.h. You can also find [examples](https://github.com/Luos-io/Examples/blob/master/Projects/l0/) which are using this feature. For now, examples using timestamp are :
- distance
- light sensor
- potentiometer
