# Get started

This page allows you to build, flash, run, and control your very first Luos code.

This Get started is separated in 2 parts:

1.  **The embedded part**: By following this part you will have all the tools you need to easily develop using Luos in your embedded target.
2.  **The remote control part**: By following this part you will have all the tools you need to take control and easily test any Luos device.

In order to complete this tutorial you will need to install dependancies such as <a href="https://www.python.org" target="_blank">Python &#8599;</a>, <a href="https://git-scm.com/" target="_blank">GIT &#8599;</a>, the USB driver compatible with your board and <a href="https://ipython.org/" target="_blank">Ipython &#8599;</a>. Although the purpose of this tutorial is not to guide you through the installation of these dependancies, we will recommand some links to help you along the process.
