This page allows you to build, flash, run, and control your very first Luos code and Luos network.

This Getting started is separated in 3 parts:
 - **The embedded part**: By following this part you will have all the tools you need to easily develop using Luos in your embedded target.
 - **The remote control part**: By following this part you will have all the tools you need to take control and easily test any Luos device.
 - **The network part**: By following this part you will have your very first Luos network.

## The embedded part: Run your first embedded app!

This tutorial shows you how to quickly upload a Luos application on an MCU development kit.

Supported boards are listed below:

- Arduino zero, MKRzero, MKR1000, or any SAMD21-based Arduino board
- STM32L432KC Nucleo

> **Note:** This list will grow longer with time.

Let's do this!
