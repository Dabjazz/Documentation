# Part 1: The transmission, and reception management

[Luos_engine library](https://github.com/Luos-io/luos_engine) provides a complete mailing system between services.

The role of Robus is to transmit and receive through the network messages to and from other nodes.

## Transmission

When `Luos_send` API is called, the message to transmit is stored in the Luos_engine [message](/docs/next/luos-technology/messages) allocator `msg_alloc.c`.

Depending on the target of this message Luos_engine will pass it to a local service ([localhost](http://localhost) network) or to a [network layer](/docs/next/luos-technology/node/luos-hal), in this case, Robus.

Depending on the state of the network Luos will be able to ask the Luos_engine [message allocator](https://github.com/Luos-io/luos_engine/blob/main/network/robus/src/msg_alloc.c) if a TX message is available, and send it if there is.

At the beginning of transmission, Robus will check if there is any collision with another node transmitting at the same time.

At the end of transmission, Robus will add some sanity checks and ACK management.

Check [transmission.c](https://github.com/Luos-io/luos_engine/blob/main/network/robus/src/transmission.c) files for a better understanding of the transmission process and functions

## Reception

Robus reuse the format of the Luos_engine messages as the base of its protocol. Robus use a multipoint network so any transmitted messages will be broadcasted to any nodes on the network.

During message reception, Robus will use the message [header](/docs/next/luos-technology/messages#header) and the information of the node itâ€™s running on to know if it needs to keep this message or not.

To finish, at the end of the message, Robus will check the integrity send back an ACK if needed, and store the message into the Luos_engine allocator.
