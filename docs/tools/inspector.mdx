# Inspector

The Inspector is a major tool of the Luos eco-system. It's allowing you to link low level (embedded Luos Services) and Luos SAAS, throught serial binary protocol. Inspector catch all the information that pass through a Luos network and send to high level to display the topology or to monitor the network.  Contrary to the Gate application which became a “master” when it’s in a network, The Inspector application is completly transparent for you embbeded application!

You can use it to catch any informations on the Luos network and visualise information in the Luos SAAS.

The Inspector is a simple embedded [App service](../luos-technology/services/service-api#apps-guidelines), so it can work on any MCU running Luos without any modification. The Inspector service must be used with a driver service called **pipe** allowing you to choose the communication way fitting with your project (USB, Wifi, Bluetooth, etc.). Before you may use the inspector a topology detection must be perform!

## Default Inspector Process

The default behavior of the Inspector is transparency. this service doesn’t do anything until it received some special command dedicated to inspector

1. At power up, the inspector is quiet and only reponse to a topology detection procedure. It’s possible to configure the inspector to perform at power up a topology detection (optionnal)
2. The inspector wait to receive a “ask presency” message from a pipe.
3. If response ok, High level can ask information from the inspector such as
    1. Routing Table
    2. Statistic of a node
    3. message pass through the network

## Inspector and pipe

In that configuration you put 2 services in the node like below.

```c
#include "luos.h"
#include "pipe.h"
#include "inspector.h"

int main(void)
{
  Luos_Init();
  Pipe_Init();
  Inspector_Init();

  while (1)
  {
    Luos_Loop();
    Pipe_Loop();
    Inspector_Loop();
  }
}
```

## The Gate configurations

The default process described above can be changed using different configurations that you can use on [your node_config.h](/docs/luos-technology/basics/orga#configuration).

You could need to change it if you have Apps on you Luos embedded system.

|   Parameters   | Defaults value |                            Description                             |
| :------------: | :------------: | :----------------------------------------------------------------: |
|  NODETECTION   |  NOT DEFINED   |            Inspector do not make detection a power up              |

If you have an App service on your device managing detections you should define **NODETECTION** avoiding useless detection from the Inspector at boot.

## Inspector Vs Gate

As for gate, Inspector need a pipe to tranferts information outside of the Luos network. Pipe and Inspector can be hosted into the same or on differents **node** of the network . It’s recommanded to have an inspector and pipe on the same node to not overload the Luos newtork with msg that can be handle localy on the node. (see Gate)

Inspector can be use with The Gate on a network, Gate taking control of the sensor and Inspector displaying all the informations for exemple

:::caution
A gate and an Inspector can’t share a pipe!
So in the same network, you must have one pipe for each service preferably place on the same node
