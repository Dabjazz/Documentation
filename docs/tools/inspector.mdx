# Inspector

The Inspector is a major tool of the Luos ecosystem. It's allowing you to link low level (embedded Luos services) and the Luos Network Display tool, through a serial binary protocol. The Inspector catches all the information that passes through a Luos network and sends it to the high level to display the topology or to monitor the network online. Contrary to the Gate application which become a “master” when it is in a network, The Inspector application is completely transparent for you embedded application.

You can use it to catch any information on the Luos network and visualize information in the Luos SAAS.

The Inspector is a simple embedded [App service](../luos-technology/services/service-api#apps-guidelines), so it can work on any MCU running Luos without any modification. The Inspector service must be used with a driver service called **pipe**, allowing you to choose the communication way fitting with your project (USB, WiFi, Bluetooth, etc.). Before you may use the Inspector a topology detection must be perform!

## Default Inspector Process

The default behavior of the Inspector is transparency. This service does not do anything until it received some special command dedicated to the Inspector.

1. At power up, the Inspector is quiet and only responds to a topology detection procedure. It is possible to configure the Inspector to perform a topology detection at power up (optional)
2. The Inspector waits to receive an "ask presence" message from a pipe.
3. If the response is OK, high level can ask information from the Inspector such as:
    1. routing table,
    2. statistics of a node,
    3. message passing through the network.

## Inspector and pipe

In that configuration, you put two services in the node as shown below:

```c
#include "luos.h"
#include "pipe.h"
#include "inspector.h"

int main(void)
{
  Luos_Init();
  Pipe_Init();
  Inspector_Init();

  while (1)
  {
    Luos_Loop();
    Pipe_Loop();
    Inspector_Loop();
  }
}
```

## The Inspector configurations

The default process described above can be changed using different configurations that you can use on [the file *node_config.h*](/docs/luos-technology/basics/orga#configuration).

You could need to change it if you have apps on you Luos embedded system.

|   Parameters   | Defaults value |                            Description                             |
| :------------: | :------------: | :----------------------------------------------------------------: |
|  NODETECTION   |  NOT DEFINED   |            Inspector does not make detection at power up              |

If you have an App service on your device managing detection you should define **NODETECTION** avoiding useless detection from the Inspector at boot.

## Inspector vs. Gate

As for the Gate, the Inspector needs a pipe to transfer information outside the Luos network. The Pipe and Inspector can be hosted into the same node or on different **nodes** in the network. It is recommended to have an Inspector and a Pipe on the same node to not overload the Luos network with messages that can be handled locally on the node. (see the [Gate page](/docs/tools/gate).)

The Inspector can be used with The Gate in a network, the Gate taking control of the sensors and the Inspector displaying all the information, for example.

:::caution
A Gate and an Inspector can not share a pipe.
You must have one pipe for each service in the same network, preferably placed in the same node.
