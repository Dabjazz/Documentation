# Contribute to Luos

## Contribution

As an open source project, Luos is open to contribution. It means that anyone can actively contribute in improving the project by reporting bugs or typos, or working on issues and pull requests.

This page explains how to begin you journey through contribution.

## Luos's contribution guidelines

The first step is to read [Luos's contribution guidelines](https://github.com/Luos-io/luos_engine/blob/main/CONTRIBUTING.md) to discover the basics and the different layers of contribution.


## Issues and PR

After this reading, the next step is to get familiar with the [workflow](https://docs.github.com/en/get-started/quickstart/github-flow) we use with GitHub. Basically, it is about issues and pull requests.

### Issues

As a contributor, you will sometimes open new issues, for example if you spot a typo, want to report a bug, or request a new feature. 

But you will also be able to contribute by commenting in existing issues by bringing some inputs and discussing bug resolving or feature implementing with other contributors.

Before to create a new issue:
- Verify what you want to talk about: if you are reporting a bug, are you sure it is an actual bug and not a particular way of using Luos that doesn't suite you in a particular case?
- If you want to request a feature, did you check that there is no way to do what you want to do? Do not hesitate to search in the <a href="https://docs.luos.io/docs" target ="_blank">documentation</a> first and <a href="https://discord.gg/luos" target ="_blank">ask questions on the Discord</a> before to rush in the creation of an issue.
- Ensure that no other issue has been opened before on the same subject, to prevent any duplicate. You can [use the search bar](https://docs.github.com/en/search-github/searching-on-github/searching-issues-and-pull-requests) with various filters. 

### Pull requests (PR)

The PR are a level above the issues, as opening a PR implies that you modified the code of Luos and want to merge your changes with the main code.

When you open a PR:
- Ensure that no other PR is linked to the same issue(s) and doing the same job you want to do with yours.
- Link the issue(s) you want to solve.
- Apply the right labels to help others find your PR.


## Labels

The issues and PR are tagged with various labels that help filtering during search. The labels dealing with contribution are the following.



### help wanted
