# Get Started

## 1. Description

The Get started allows you to build, flash, run, and control your very first Luos project.

This section is separated into three parts:

1. Part 1: Your first Luos Project: the embedded part, where you will have all the tools you need to easily develop using Luos in your embedded target.
2. Part 2: Take the control: the remote control part, where you will have all the tools you need to take control and quickly test any Luos device.
3. Part 3: Unleash your code: the last part will guide you in creating your first Luos network allowing you to deal with a multiple-boards system.

In order to complete this tutorial, you will need to install dependencies such as **[Python](https://www.python.org/)**, **[GIT](https://git-scm.com/)**, **[Ipython](https://ipython.org/)**, and a USB driver compatible with your board. Although the purpose of this tutorial is not to guide you through the installation of these dependencies, we will recommend some links to help you along the process.

## 2. Level guidelines

### Pre-requisite:

- [Training repository](https://github.com/Luos-io/Get_started)
- [Luos Basics](/docs/luos-technology/basics/basics)

### Equipment you will need:

Luos engine is compatible with any MCU available on the market but needs a HAL (Hardware Abstraction Layer) to fit the network and adequately work. Luos provides some of these, allowing you to use Luos library plug and play.

Below is a list of boards allowing this Get started tutorial to be plug-and-play:

- **[Arduino zero](https://www.arduino.cc/en/Main/ArduinoBoardZero&)**, **[MKRzero](https://store.arduino.cc/products/arduino-mkr-zero-i2s-bus-sd-for-sound-music-digital-audio-data)**, **[MKR1000](https://store.arduino.cc/collections/boards/products/arduino-mkr1000-wifi)**, or any **[SAMD21-based](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_Arduino_boards_and_compatible_systems)** Arduino boards
- **[STM32L432KC Nucleo](https://www.st.com/en/evaluation-tools/nucleo-l432kc.html)**
- **[STM32F072RB Nucleo](https://www.st.com/en/evaluation-tools/nucleo-f072rb.html)**
- **[STM32F401RE Nucleo](https://www.st.com/en/evaluation-tools/nucleo-f401re.html)**
- **[STM32F410RB Nucleo](https://www.st.com/en/evaluation-tools/nucleo-f410rb.html)**
- **[STM32G431KB Nucleo](https://www.st.com/en/evaluation-tools/nucleo-g431kb.html)**

This tutorial shows you how to upload a Luos application on a Microcontroller Unit (MCU) and use the development kit (SDK pyhton Luos call Pyluos).

### Total estimated time:

- Part 1: 15 minutes
- Part 2: 15 minutes
- Part 3: 30 minutes

### Estimated difficulty level: Easy
