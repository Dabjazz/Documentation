# Part 1: Environnement

## 1. Introduction

In this tutorial, we learn to perform the following essential actions:

1. Set up the embedded environment on Espressif IDE
2. Flash a service button, create a luos network and detect your service

## 2. Set up your environnement

The only two thing you will need for now it’s a ESP32 developpement Board and a USB cable.

:::caution
Remember that Luos only covers ESP32 series, ESP32-S2, ESP32-S3 and ESP32-C3 familly.
:::

Plug usb cable in USB port of the board, clone or download the [luos_engine repository](https://github.com/Luos-io/luos_engine).

And let’s start !

### Espressif IDE (only for Windows users)

1. From espressif web site download the last version of [espressif IDE](https://dl.espressif.com/dl/esp-idf/) and follow [the installation instruction](https://docs.espressif.com/projects/esp-idf/en/latest/esp32/get-started/windows-setup.html)

2. Start Espressif IDE

3. Import the project in your IDE

<div align="center">

</div>

4. From the folder luos_engine that you’ve just cloned or downloaded, browse to the folder ../examples/projects/ESP32/button. Import your project.
   Click on Finish.

5. Now you have your project added in the IDE:
   1. Select the target that you want to build for
   2. Click on the Hammer to build your project
   3. At the end of building your project, folders build and esp_id_component are created
   4. A file sdkconfig file appears, containing the default configuration for our target

</div>

6. Modify your sdkconfig. By default Usart Iram functions are not declared in Ram. You must set up them in Ram

:::caution
Find the line :
#CONFIG_UART_ISR_IN_IRAM is not set
remplace with the line :
CONFIG_UART_ISR_IN_IRAM=y

</div>

7. Now you have placed all the part of the code needed in RAM, you must rebuild the code.

</div>

b. be sur it’s the right project selected to upload in your board

c. click on run application

:::warning
You may need to press reset button shortly before flashing your board
:::

You successfully manage to upload you first button service in an ESP Board! Ok great but what is the next step?

A button service like that is not really interresting alone but Lets try to take it under control by being detected on a Luos Network.
