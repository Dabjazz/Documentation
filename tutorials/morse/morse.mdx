  time="1 hour"

  category="Tutorials"
  desc="We will go through the explanation of the Morse encoder algorithm, and its encapsulation into a Luos service. Finally we will see, using examples, how we can exploit the output of the encoder algorithm, as well as, how we can generate and share an input, so as to be encoded by the application."
