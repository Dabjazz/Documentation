  title="How to make a Morse Encoder"
  time="1 hour"
  level="Confirmed"
  category="Tutorial"
  desc="You just heard about Luos, or you have already finished the Luos Get started and Trainings and you want to go further: this tutorial is for you! We will accompany you from scratch and step by step with your first project with Luos. We will browse and explain Luos main API through a simple and fun project called Morse encoder. This project will allow you to send a character through a serial interface of a Nucleo STM32F072RB board. This character will be parsed by an application, encoded in morse code, and sent to a LED on a board that will blink correspondingly. At the end of this tutorial, you will understand how a Luos project is structured, Luos API creation of service, and topology detection."
