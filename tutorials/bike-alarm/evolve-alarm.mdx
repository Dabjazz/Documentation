# Make our alarm evolve using a truck horn and more
For now our alarm doesn’t make any noise, which is sad for an alarm. Let’s make some noise.

To do that, I will add another board to my setup with a relay switch.
In this power switch, I put a 12V truck horn producing 150db.

  />
</div>

To control it I will simply have to manage it on my apps and use the standard power_switch driver.

## Add the truck horn on alarm_controller app
I simply want the horn to turn on at the same time the red LED is blinking. So I add a small message after the LED’s one in the loop of the app :

```c
RTFilter_Alias(RTFilter_Reset(&result), "horn");
if (result.result_nbr > 0)
{
    // We get a horn
    uint8_t horn = 0;
    if (!blink)
    {
        // Turn the horn on
        horn = 1;
    }
    msg_t msg;
    msg.header.target      = result.result_table[0]->id;
    msg.header.target_mode = IDACK;
    msg.header.size        = sizeof(uint8_t);
    msg.header.cmd         = IO_STATE;
    msg.data[0]            = horn;
    Luos_SendMsg(app, &msg);
}
```

As you can see, I call the power_switch driver “horn”. When you use alias to get ID of a service, always make sure to rename it.

The simplest way to rename a service is to use a Gate and Pyluos.

## Add the truck horn on start_controller app
In this app, I add a small “BIP” when locking or unlocking the bike. In order to add it, I have to add more code than in the previous app to manage time properly.
I let you consult [the final code](https://github.com/Luos-io/Luos/tree/main/Examples/Apps/Start_controller).

I took advantage of this code modification to add some fancy animation on the LED, allowing it to be used as bicycle headlight.

## Improvement clue
To make it usable in real life, we should probably select something less noisy than a truck horn which is really painful for the ears.
Also we should add a real locking system able to lock the bike wheel using a motor and a mechanism like this one made by my friends from [pony](https://getapony.com/):

We can also add connectivity to set up the bike using a mobile app or something. This part is interesting, so let’s talk about that on the next chapter.
