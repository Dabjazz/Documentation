# RTOS with Luos engine

:::info
This tutorial uses FreeRTOS, but the main concepts can be used for any other RTOS. The configuration options may vary depending on the RTOS API you are using.
:::

:::caution
This tutorial considers the reader as a FreeRTOS user. This is not a tutorial to learn how to use FreeRTOS.
:::

In this tutorial, we will see how to use Luos with an RTOS and discover the benefits of this combination.

## 1. Set up a PlatformIO project

In this tutorial, we will use the examples available in [the Luos engine's repository](https://github.com/Luos-io/Luos/tree/main).
You can [download](https://github.com/Luos-io/Luos/archive/refs/heads/main.zip) and unzip it or clone it using: 

```
Git clone https://github.com/Luos-io/Luos_engine.git
```

As a quick reminder, you will find in this project:

- a **src/** folder containing a **main.c** whose main purpose is to call **services** and **Luos engine**'s initialization functions. This folder also contains the file _stm32f0xx_it.c_ in which we define interrupt handlers.
- a **lib/** folder containing services source files.

## 2. Use FreeRTOS in your project

Open Visual Studio Code and open a **Led** project corresponding to your master board in **Luos_engine/Examples/Projects/YOUR_BOARD**.

:::caution
If you are not comfortable with the opening and compiling of a Luos engine project, please follow [the Luos Get started tutorial](../get-started) first.
:::

Now we need to import FreeRTOS source files in our project. To do that we will use the PlatformIO registry and add a [dependency to FreeRTOS])(https://registry.platformio.org/libraries/bojit/PlatformIO-FreeRTOS). Then at compilation time PlatformIO will download it and include it on our project.

To do that open the _platformio.ini_ file of your project and add a FreeRTOS dependency: 

```json
lib_deps = 
    Luos_engine@^2.2.0
    Led
    bojit/PlatformIO-FreeRTOS
```

To properly work, this lib needs to know which MCU family you are working on (like Luos engine), so you have to add a compilation option to define your platform.
For example, for STM32F0 you have to add the compilation flag `-DSTM32F0`.

:::info
More details about it on [the PlatformIO library's readme](https://registry.platformio.org/libraries/bojit/PlatformIO-FreeRTOS).
:::

In this tutorial, we will also use [CMSIS_RTOS_V2](https://arm-software.github.io/CMSIS_5/RTOS2/html/rtos_api2.html) to have a generic RTOS API. You will have to find the lib corresponding to your provider's and MCU. If you prefer to directly use FreeRTOS API, you will have to adapt the code of this tutorial, no big deal...

:::info
You can find a ST version in [our FreeRTOS example](https://github.com/Luos-io/Luos/tree/main/Examples/Projects/l0/Button_FreeRTOS).

## 3. FreeRTOS configurations

Working with Luos FreeRTOS doesn't require any specific configuration, except for one thing: you must configure the available options in the file _FreeRTOSConfig.h_. FreeRTOS needs to handle three interrupters handlers (PendSV, SVC and systick handlers), so you must not redefine these three handlers (For STM32 user they are in **stm32f0xx_it.c**).

```c
    #define vPortSVCHandler     SVC_Handler
    #define xPortPendSVHandler  PendSV_Handler
    #define xPortSysTickHandler SysTick_Handler
```

:::info
If you want more information about the options displayed in _FreeRTOSConfig.h_, please check the [dedicated page](https://www.freertos.org/a00110.html).
:::

The only exception of this standard configuration is that Luos engine uses the systick value provided by the HAL of your ship (allowing Luos to work in a bare metal configuration). By default FreeRTOS will pre-empt this systick and manage it's own. To keep Luos working we have to provide this systick value to the HAL level

You have 3 solutions to solve this:

 - You write the systick IRQ handler by yourself increment the HAL systick then call the RTOS systick function. (We use this solution on our examples)
 - You can override the weak HAL systick function and use the RTOS systick instead of the HAL one.
 - You can use the [RTOS hook](https://www.freertos.org/a00016.html) option calling a callback at each systick allowing you to increment the HAL systick manualy.

Now we have to call the kernel routines from our **main** function. We could directly use FreeRTOS functions, but ARM defined a standard API to interface with RTOS capabilities called [CMSIS_RTOS_V2](https://arm-software.github.io/CMSIS_5/RTOS2/html/rtos_api2.html) and we will use it.

In our main, we have to remove all the Luos and services functions, becaus e we will transform them into tasks.
Then we can call the OS API in our **main.c** file:

```c
    #include "cmsis_os.h"

    int main(void)
    {
        HAL_Init();

        SystemClock_Config();

        osKernelInitialize();

        osKernelStart();
    }
```

**osKernelInitialize()** sets some FreeRTOS internal variables and **osKernelStart()** launches the scheduler by calling **vTaskStartScheduler()**.

**Let's recall what we've done so far:**

- We have used a Luos led example as a base project.
- We imported FreeRTOS sources, configured them and started the kernel from the **main** function.

If you compile and load this code in the target, nothing will happen for a simple reason: we launched the scheduler but the kernel has nothing to schedule because we don't make a task running our led. Let's fix that by creating some tasks .

## 4. Create Luos tasks

Because we based our code on a LED project, on the `lib` folder, you should have a led service ready to be used.

Lets create a new file called `freertos.c` on your `src` folder. We will use this file to creates some tasks for our led.

`freertos.c`:
```c
// RTOS includes:
    #include "FreeRTOS.h"
    #include "task.h"
    #include "cmsis_os.h"

// Luos engine includes:
    #include "luos_engine.h"
    #include "led.h"

// Luos engine task attributes:
    const osThreadAttr_t LuosTask_attributes = {
        .name       = "LuosTask",
        .stack_size = 128 * 4,
        .priority   = (osPriority_t)osPriorityNormal,
    };

// Led service task attributes:
    const osThreadAttr_t LedTask_attributes = {
        .name       = "Led",
        .stack_size = 128 * 4,
        .priority   = (osPriority_t)osPriorityNormal,
    };

// Start tasks functions:
    void StartLuosTask(void *argument);
    void StartLedTask(void *argument);

// RTOS initialization functions:
    void RTOS_Init(void);

    void MX_FREERTOS_Init(void)
    {
        // Init Luos and services
        Luos_Init();
        Led_Init();

        // Tasks creation
        osThreadNew(StartLuosTask, NULL, &LuosTask_attributes);
        osThreadNew(StartLedTask, NULL, &LedTask_attributes);
    }

    void StartLuosTask(void *argument)
    {
        while (1)
        {
            Luos_Loop();

            taskYIELD();
        }
    }

    void StartLedTask(void *argument)
    {
        while (1)
        {
            Led_Loop();

            taskYIELD();
        }
    }
```

First, we included files we need to call the RTOS and Luos engine APIs. Then we created 2 structures: **LuosTask_attributes** and **LedTask_attributes**. Those structures are used by RTOS to configure **heap** size and **priority** for each task.

Here we have 2 tasks:

- Luos task: it's used to manage the messages passing between services and to orchestrate them.
- Led task: it's used to drive a simple LED you can access from any other service.

These tasks are initialized in **RTOS_Init()** with the **osThreadNew()** routine. Notice that we called **Luos_Init()** and **Led_Init()** just before creating threads allow Luos engine and the led service to be properly setup to run.

We've created 2 threads for 1 services because the first one is dedicated to handle **Luos engine**. The 2 threads have the _same priority_ and that's important because the scheduler will place them in the _same queue_, running one after the other.

Of course you can create as many threads you want inside your service and deal with your code as you want.

One last thing, in each _task_ routine, we call the service loop then we _yield_ to the next threads. Indeed, FreeRTOS scheduler can be called in preemptive or cooperative mode. The systick will call the scheduler each milliseconds, but this implies that you will switch from one thread to the other at this period. This can be way too slow for most applications and we can improve the reactivity of the system by calling **taskYield** after each service loop routine.

## 5. Test your project

To test your project you can add a Pipe and Gate packages (you can find [available packages on the `Gate_SerialCom` project corresponding to your board](https://github.com/Luos-io/Luos/tree/main/Examples/Projects)), add the code in the **lib/** folder and instanciate it by creating a new task in **freertos.c**.

Now you can build your project in VSCode and load it to your board. Once the board is flashed, you can use the `pyluos-shell` command on your computer to control your led through python.

## 6. Main advantages

From a developer using an RTOS point of view, Luos engine allow you to synchronize your features accross multiple tasks and multiple nodes. You can see it as a distributed IPC (Inter Process Communication).

**Now you can have multiple Services across multiple nodes running in parallell on your favorite RTOS and synchronized through Luos engine.**

Luos engine brought you APIs to develop distributed applications with ease:

- Develop each application in a service
- manage messages between services through Luos engine API
- manage and monitor your network with our SaaS tools

From a developer using Luos engine point of view, FreeRTOS can help to manage services scheduling to comply with hard real-time constraints.
